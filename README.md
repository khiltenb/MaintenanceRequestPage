# MaintenanceRequestPage
A base for an addition to a company/institution website that allows for company employees/staff or institution faculty/staff to request maintenance at a specified location.

All relevant design documents will be placed in the DesDoc directory.

This is a work in progress, and this document will serve as a setup guide once the project is ready for deployment.
